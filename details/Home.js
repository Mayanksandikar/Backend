I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

Bizarre inventions fever has spread like wildfire among street vendors looking for attention on social media. Our beloved omelette too has been subjected to experimentation. One street food vendor in Delhi surprised us with a tandoori kulcha omelette and another made a no-oil omelette with water! If the thought of this omelette left you speechless, wait till you read about this new omelette creation. Instead of oil or butter or even water, a street vendor makes omelette in a cold drink! And to notch it up, he adds Oreo biscuits to sweeten the omelette with chocolate flavours."
