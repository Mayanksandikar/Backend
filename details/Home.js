            "description": "​​ How soon we renounce age-old traditions in the praxis of food, and succumb to the allure of convenience, short cuts, and finished good-looking products. I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

One street food vendor in Delhi surprised us with a tandoori kulcha omelette and another made a no-oil omelette with water! If the thought of this omelette left you speechless, wait till you read about this new omelette creation. Instead of oil or butter or even water, a street vendor makes omelette in a cold drink! And to notch it up, he adds Oreo biscuits to sweeten the omelette with chocolate flavours."

It helps in numerous ways, be it in improving flexibility, strength and posture, or reducing stress and providing a sense of calm. Nutrition and diet are an important part of fitness along with physical exercise. On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    "

Even just walking into this courtroom. Sitting here in front of the world, having the worst parts of my life, things that I have lived through, used to humiliate me. People want to kill me and they tell me so every day. People want to put my baby in the microwave, and they tell me that. She also said, I live my life with these sets of rules I've to follow, my friends have to follow for me not to have a panic attack or a triggering event or I relive the trauma, even from training to do. In my movie, for instance, for training for Aquaman, a combat scene and a trigger happen. I have a meltdown and have to deal with that, the crew I work with have to deal with that, because of the damage I walk around with every single day. I am not sitting in this courtroom snickering. I’m not sitting in this courtroom laughing, smiling, or making snide jokes. I’m not. This is horrible. A jury is scheduled to hear the closing arguments on Friday in Johnny's lawsuit against Amber. Each side will have two hours to summarise their case in a trial that has stretched on for six weeks. Johnny Depp is suing Amber for $50 million in Virginia's Fairfax County Circuit Court over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”. His lawyers say he was defamed by the article even though it never mentioned his name."

You upload a photo of a face, check a box agreeing to the terms of service and then get a grid of photos of faces deemed similar, with links to where they appear on the internet. The New York Times used PimEyes on the faces of a dozen Times journalists, with their consent, to test its powers.PimEyes found photos of every person, some that the journalists had never seen before, even when they were wearing sunglasses or a mask, or their face was turned away from the camera, in the image used to conduct the search. PimEyes found one reporter dancing at an art museum event a decade ago, and crying after being proposed to, a photo that she didn’t particularly like but that the photographer had decided to use to advertise his business on Yelp. A tech reporter’s younger self was spotted in an awkward crush of fans at the Coachella music festival in 2011. A foreign correspondent appeared in countless wedding photos, evidently the life of every party, and in the blurry background of a photo taken of someone else at a Greek airport in 2019. A journalist’s past life in a rock band was unearthed, as was another’s preferred summer camp getaway."
