Hypertension is essentially high blood pressure, and those who suffer from it may not exhibit any symptoms initially as it develops over the course of many years. This lack of symptoms makes it undetectable in time to prevent it or take remedial action, experts say.“Holistic practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, help handle stress in a productive and effective manner. Devote your efforts to a regular practice of yogic techniques like asanas, pranayama, and meditation practice that will guarantee your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being,” said Grand Master Akshar, a yoga master."

His fitness trainer, Pawan Jatwa, recently shared a video in which the Hero actor could be seen flexing his muscles. According to Bala Krishna Reddy Dabbedi, a fitness expert, and co-founder, director at Fittr, people usually think that they can pick up from where they left and that their original strength will be the same — “but that will not be the case”. “It’s easy to compare yourself to the times when you were training regularly. But, if there has been a gap in your gymming routine, it’s reasonable to see a decline in strength, endurance, and overall muscle,” he expressed.Assess again, test your current strength levels and train accordingly, he suggested. “There is something called muscle memory which helps one get back to their previous strength levels and muscle mass, but this takes times — from a few weeks to even some months. Just be consistent and positive till you get there. On resuming, do not start with an intense program. Keep it minimal, start slow, and you may even experience muscle soreness and pain. Eventually increase the intensity with every passing week,” she said."
